# Web API Code Quiz
UT Austin Boot Camp challenge where I have to made a quiz of four JavaScript questions with a timer. <br>
Time is taken away if an asnwer is incorrect.<br>
A form is made at the end of the quiz so the player can enter their name.<br>
The player can recall their last score from localStorage.
